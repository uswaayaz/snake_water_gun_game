# snake_water_gun_game
Code Explanation:

This Python code simulates a classic game of Snake, Water, and Gun. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Import and Initialization:

The code starts by importing the random module, which is used to generate a random choice for the computer.
It assigns numerical values to represent Snake (1), Water (-1), and Gun (0) for easier comparison.
It creates dictionaries to map these numerical values to their corresponding string representations and vice versa.
Computer's Choice:

The computer randomly selects one of the three options (Snake, Water, or Gun) and assigns it to the computer variable.
User's Choice:

The user is prompted to enter their choice (s for Snake, w for Water, or g for Gun).
The user's input is converted into a numerical value using the youdict dictionary.
Output:

The code prints both the computer's and the user's choices in their string format.
Determining the Winner:

If the computer's and user's choices are the same, it's a tie.
Otherwise, the code checks various conditions to determine the winner based on the rules of the game:
Snake drinks Water, so if the computer chooses Water (-1) and the user chooses Snake (1), the user wins.
Gun kills Snake, so if the computer chooses Snake (1) and the user chooses Gun (0), the user wins.
Water drowns Gun, so if the computer chooses Gun (0) and the user chooses Water (-1), the user wins.
In all other cases, the computer wins.
Error Handling:

If none of the conditions match, it indicates an error in the input or logic, and the code prints an error message.
Overall, the code effectively simulates a game of Snake, Water, and Gun by randomly generating the computer's choice, allowing user input, and determining the winner based on the game's rules.
